> **TODO (coming soon!)**
> - [ ] üì¶ **Release DiffForensics code & checkpoints**

---

Official implementation of DiffForensics from our CVPR 2024 paper ‚ÄúDiffForensics: Leveraging Diffusion Prior to Image Forgery Detection and Localization‚Äù.

---

To facilitate fair comparisons for researchers working on Image Forgery Detection and Localization (IFDL), we publicly release the prediction results (pixel-level outputs) of our model. Other resources (e.g., training code and model weights) are still being organized and will be updated later.
